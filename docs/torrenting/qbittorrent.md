# qBittorrent

qBittorrent is an [open-source](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent) torrent client. Not only can the client be installed on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but it is possible to run it on the web with a slick (but slightly outdated) interface.

## Getting Started

Using qBittorrent is quite simple. Begin by downloading it from [their website](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) and running the installer. Upon installing, you should see an image similar to the one displayed above. To add a torrent file or magnet link, click on the "link" button in the top left corner.

You should then see a large textbox apear. Paste your torrent/magnet link into this box, then click "Download". Congratulations, you've began downloading a torrent in qBittorrent!

## Binding to a VPN

When using a VPN, you should never trust the VPN client killswitch feature. Instead, you should bind your client to the VPN's network interface. This is an effective solution for preventing traffic leaks. First, go to hover over the "Tools" tab, then click on "Preferences" (alternatively, you can run ALT+O on Windows and Linux). Then, click on "Advanced". You should see a box where you can set your network interface to bind to.
