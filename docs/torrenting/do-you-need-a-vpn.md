# Do I Need a VPN?

Probably. If downloading content you really shouldn't be, you'll most likley get some sort of a DMCA notice in your email ([or your real mail](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/comcast-dmca-letter.jpg)). [Even legal torrenting sometimes gets ISPs upset](https://torrentfreak.com/comcast-subscriber-receives-dmca-notice-for-downloading-ubuntu-210526/). The following is a chart to determine if you need a VPN for torrenting.

If:
* You live in North America, Europe, other any other region that enforces DMCA
* Your ISP throttles Bittorrent

**You should use a VPN for torrenting**

If:
* Your country/region does not enforce DMCA
* Your ISP does not throttle Bittorrent

**You do not need a VPN for torrenting**
