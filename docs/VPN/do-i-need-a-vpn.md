# Do I Need a VPN?

This chart will help you determine if you need a VPN, Tor, or neither:

| Objective         | VPN     | Tor |
|--------------|-----------|------------|------------|
| I don't want hackers to see my passwords on public wifi! | No      | No      |
| I don't want the government spying on my browsing. | No | Yes | 
| I don't want my school/company spying on my browsing. | Yes | Yes |
| I want to improve my internet privacy. | No | Yes |
| I want to torrent. | [Maybe](/torrenting/do-you-need-a-vpn) | No |
| I want to browse the internet with complete anonymity. | No | Maybe |

## Reasoning/Explainations

1) Most bank sites and apps use encryption (TLS) so this isn't a concern.
2) Goverments can inspect the internet backbone and the traffic on it. Tor prevents this type of sniffing.
3) VPNs and Tor can bypass firewalls at work and school and can prevent them from seeing what websites you are visiting.
4) A VPN will not protect you from fingerprinting are targeted ads. Tor (with the correct seurity settings) can.
5) Maybe, see [Do You Need a VPN?](/torrenting/do-you-need-a-vpn). Never torrent over Tor.
6) Achieving true anonymity on the internet is hard, if not impossible, and a VPN certainly won't do it.
