# Liar VPNs

Here is a short list of VPNs that have claimed to take no logs, but evidence has proved overwise. Most of the time, a VPN service will be exposed for giving data to the police, then will cover it up by citing a section from their TOS or ordering an audit.

## PureVPN

**Situation:** PureVPN has always claimed to keep no logs. However, a court case in which PureVPN [provided data to the FBI for a stalking case](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyberstalking-suspect-arrested-after-vpn-providers-shared-logs-with-the-fbi/). PureVPN responded to an inquiry by the FBI and confirmed that a specific user was on their VPN at a certain time. At the time, their [privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20161010042248/https://www.purevpn.com/privacy-policy.php) stated that they "...Do Not monitor user activity nor do we keep any logs. We therefore have no record of your activities such as which software you used, which websites you visited, what content you downloaded, which apps you used, etc. after you connected to any of our servers." 

**Response:** You can read PureVPN's [statement](https://www.purevpn.com/blog/vpn-logs-explained/) on the case.

## HideMyAss / HMA

**Situation:** HideMyAss, commonly known as "HMA", gave up logs [relating to hacking group LulzSec](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hide-my-ass-throws-light-on-lulzsec-logs/) to the FBI. It turns out that while HMA claimed to be logless, they recorded IPs and timestamps.

**Response:** [The company claims to have changed since the incident no longer takes logs.](https://blog.hidemyass.com/en/lulzsec-fiasco) 

## EarthVPN

**Situation:** EarthVPN was caught logging when they handed logs over to [Dutch police relating to a threat](https://web.archive.org/web/20180320105826/http://www.wipeyourdata.com/other-data-erasing/no-logs-earthvpn-user-arrested-after-police-finds-logs/).
