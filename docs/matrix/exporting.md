A window will pop up with options on how to export the chat. **Format** provides options such as HTML (readable by Humans), **JSON** (readable by computers), and **Plain Text** (readable by humans, but a much smaller file size, and it doesn't look as nice).

For messages, select current timeline if you only want the last few messages. If you would like the entire chat exported, select "From the beginning".

## 3. The Export

After selecting the maximum file size, press "Export". You will have to pick a folder to save the .zip file in. Once you press save, you will have a ZIP file with your Matrix chat messages.
